## Introduction

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP) is the United States' largest federal nutrition assistance program with the government spending $182.5 billion in fiscal year 2021 on the program [(USDA ERS, 2022)](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/food-security-and-nutrition-assistance/?topicId=d7627f77-6cee-4ab9-bbb9-8c74d4778941). SNAP plays an important role in increasing food access in low-income, marginalized communities by providing benefits for food items on an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) card that operates similarly to a debit card. Despite the hundreds of billions of dollars that are allocated to SNAP, food insecurity is still prevalent and has been exacerbated due to COVID-19 in many American communities, especially in rural America.

In prevailing political dialogue, rural is often used as a dog-whistle for "white." This is both misleading and factually incorrect, as there are significant pockets of racial and ethnic diversity in the contemporaneous rural American landscape. As discussions about the 2023 Farm Bill are well underway on Capitol Hill and nutrition assistance programs historically constitute the largest share of Farm Bill dollars, the efficacy of SNAP reaching impoverished communities in totality, but particularly in communities of color, is at the center of my curiosity. Taken together, I am interested in investigating if SNAP is being accessed by those who are living below the federal poverty line in rural and small town counties, and if SNAP access differs in counties with higher populations of Black and Latino communities. 

I have chosen to narrow in on my home state of Florida as its geographic position in the Southeastern United States and heterogeneous demographic makeup of the state makes for an interesting case study. Tangentially, as someone who grew up in small town Florida and consistently learns about urban sprawl and the suburbanization of the US, I wanted to use this opportunity to learn about more about the people and trends in places that mirror the one I call home.

## Data

  The data used to explore these questions come from two sources. [The Food Research and Action Center](https://frac.org/maps/snap-county-map/tables/snap-county-tab-2019.html), or FRAC, has data that encompasses variables of state, county, metro/small town/rural distinctions, percentage with SNAP, and percent margin error. This data is FRAC's analysis of 5-year 2015-2019 American Community Survey data.

  I combined the FRAC dataset with data collected by the [Census](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-detail.html) that includes county-level poverty rates and racial demographic information to investigate the question: do rural and small town counties in Florida with high minority populations also have high rates of SNAP enrollment? This data was collected between 2010-2019.

  Considering that SNAP fundamentally operates to assist low-income households, my first hypothesis is that counties with higher poverty rates also have higher rates of SNAP enrollment. Because of the laborious nature of SNAP enrollment, I further hypothesize that the rural and small town counties with higher levels of minority residents have lower rates of SNAP enrollment. Because enrollment relies on internet access or access to offices with lengthy queues that are solely open during business hours coupled with the stigmatization of receiving federal benefits because of the "Welfare Queen" rhetoric of the Reagan Era - these rural and small town communities of color may not have the same access or desire to enroll in these kinds of program. My explanatory variables of interest are percentage of minority residents (how many residents are Black and/or Latino/Hispanic) and poverty rate (how many residents are living under the federal rate). My outcome variable is SNAP enrollment. 
  
  Trends that would support my first hypothesis would be a close relationship between SNAP enrollment and poverty rates, whereas no relationship between poverty and SNAP enrollment would fail to support my first hypothesis. Patterns that would support my second hypothesis would be high minority populations, high rates of poverty, but low SNAP enrollment. Trends that would fail to support my second hypothesis would show no or little relationship between poverty rates, racial/ethnic demographic breakdown, and SNAP enrollment when I run my regression. 
  
   I have filtered this dataset so that it only evaluates rural and small town counties in Florida. According to FRAC, "'Small town counties' are those contained within Micropolitan Statistical Areas, as delineated by Office of Management and Budget, each containing at least one Census Bureau-delineated urban cluster of between 10,000 and 50,000 people. 'Rural counties' consist of non-metropolitan and non-micropolitan areas."
  
Of the 67 counties in Florida, 23 are considered small town or rural. Those counties are:

* Bradford County 
* Calhoun County
* Columbia County 
* DeSoto County 
* Dixie County 
* Franklin County 
* Glades County 
* Hamilton County 
* Hardee County
* Hendry County 
* Holmes County 
* Jackson County 
* Lafayette County
* Levy County 
* Liberty County 
* Madison County 
* Monroe County
* Okeechobee County 
* Putnam County 
* Suwannee County
* Taylor County
* Union County, and
* Washington County. 

Columbia, DeSoto, Hardee, Hendry, Monroe, Okeechobee, and Putnam Counties are considered "small town" with the remaining 16 counties being "rural areas."

My research design is cross-sectional as I am evaluating SNAP enrollment, poverty, and racial demographics of counties at one point in time. 

#### The variables in my dataset are as follows:

* county - County name  
* total_poverty - Percentage of total population living below the federal poverty level 
* under18_poverty - Percentage of the under 18 population living below the federal poverty level
* smalltown_rural - If the county is considered a small town or rural based on population size
* pct_with_snap - Percentage of the total population receiving SNAP benefits
* pop_blacklatino - Percentage of the total population that is Black and/or Latino 
* black_pop - Percentage of the total population that is Black
* latino_pop - Percentage of the total population that is Latino/Hispanic

         total_poverty = total_est_pct3,
         under18_poverty = under18_pct3) 
```

  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +

cor_snappoverty <- cor(poverty_snapflorida$pct_with_snap, poverty_snapflorida$total_poverty)

cor_snappoverty

snappoverty.lm <- lm(pct_with_snap ~ total_poverty, poverty_snapflorida)

    "(Intercept)" = "Intercept",
    "total_poverty" = "Percentage of Total Population in Poverty")


modelsummary::modelsummary(snappoverty.lm,
                           statistic = c("s.e. = {std.error}",
                                         "p = {p.value}"),
                           coef_map = var_labels_2,
                           gof_map = c("nobs", "r.squared", "adj.r.squared"))

```
This plot illustrates the relationship between poverty rates in a county and the rate of SNAP enrollment in small town and rural counties in Florida. The regression line shows the on the plot and correlation coeefficent shows a positive relationship between SNAP enrollment and poverty rate. Furthermore, the regression table with SNAP enrollment as the response/dependent variable and percentage of total population in poverty, the p. value is less than 0.001, indicating a statistically significant relationship between these variables. The -3.384 intercept indicates the level of SNAP enrollment if there was no one living below the poverty line in a county. According to the regression, with each percentage increase of poverty in a county, the increase in SNAP enrollment is 1.192%. 

### Relationship between SNAP Enrollment and Black and Latino Population

```{r}

snapplot <- poverty_snapflorida %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pop_blacklatino, y = pct_with_snap)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "SNAP Benefits and Black/Latino Populations in Rural/Small Town Florida Counties",
       y = "Percentage of Total Population with SNAP",
       x = "Percentage Black and Latino in Total Population")

snapplot

cor_snaprace <- cor(poverty_snapflorida$pct_with_snap, poverty_snapflorida$pop_blacklatino)

cor_snaprace

cor_racepoverty <- cor(poverty_snapflorida$total_poverty, poverty_snapflorida$pop_blacklatino)

cor_racepoverty

```


```{r}
snaprace.lm <- lm(pct_with_snap ~ pop_blacklatino, poverty_snapflorida)

var_labels_1 <- c(
    "(Intercept)" = "Intercept",
    "pop_blacklatino" = "Percentage of Black and Latino in Population")


modelsummary::modelsummary(snaprace.lm,
                           statistic = c("s.e. = {std.error}",
                                         "p = {p.value}"),
                           coef_map = var_labels_1,
                           gof_map = c("nobs", "r.squared", "adj.r.squared"))

```

According to this regression, if there are no Black and Latino people in the population (county), then we can expect a SNAP enrollment at 19.096% in that county. When the population of Black and Latino people in a rural/small town county increases by one percent, the percentage of the population that receives SNAP increases by 0.037%. This however, is not a statistically significant relationship because of the high p-value of 0.614. The correlation coefficient between SNAP Enrollment and Black/Latino population is very low at 0.11, and the correlation coefficient between poverty rate and Black/Latino population is also low at 0.18. These correlation coefficients coupled with the high p-value indicate a statistically insignificant, non-causal relationship between race, poverty, and SNAP enrollment.

### Multiple Regression 
```{r}

a1.lm <- lm(pct_with_snap ~ pop_blacklatino + total_poverty, poverty_snapflorida)

var_labels <- c(
    "(Intercept)" = "Intercept",
    "pop_blacklatino" = "Percentage of Black and Latino in Population",
    "total_poverty" = "Percentage of Population in Poverty")

modelsummary::modelsummary(a1.lm,
                           statistic = c("s.e. = {std.error}",
                                         "p = {p.value}"),
                           coef_map = var_labels,
                           gof_map = c("nobs", "r.squared", "adj.r.squared"))


```

Much like the singular regressions, the multiple regression shows a strong relationship between percentage of population in poverty and SNAP enrollment, and a statistically insignificant relationship between the percentage of Black and Latino people in a population and SNAP enrollment. The intercept coefficient of -3.162 indicates that if there were no Black and Latino people in a population and no poverty, we could expect SNAP enrollment to be -3.162%. According to this regression, holding poverty constant, we can expect a 0.017% decrease in SNAP enrollment with each percentage increase of Black and Latino population. The p.value of 0.719 is indicative of a statistically insignificant relationship and weak evidence of a relationship between these variables. Contrarily, holding race/ethnicity (Black/Latino) constant, we can expect a 1.207% increase of SNAP enrollment with each percentage increase of poverty in the population. The p.value of <0.001 indicates a statistically significant relationship. 

Altogether, the relationship between poverty and SNAP enrollment is statistically significant - a very intuitive finding considering that SNAP is designed to be a resource for low-income families, many of which living below the poverty line. Conversely, the relationship between large Black and Latino populations and SNAP enrollment in rural and small-town counties is statistically insignificant. The data illustrates that there is not an observable, causal relationship between these two. 

## Conclusions

Based on the data above, there is a strong relationship between poverty and SNAP enrollment in small town and rural counties in Florida, and no relationship between proportion of Black and Latino people and SNAP enrollment and poverty. Although these findings reject my secondary hypothesis of high rates of Black and Latino populations leading to lower rates of SNAP enrollment, this is good news for the State of Florida and the efficacy of SNAP reaching vulnerable populations in rural and small-town counties. The populations that are most susceptible to food insecurity are receiving SNAP benefits, regardless of race, in small town and rural Florida counties. 

This study alone is not enough to give legislators a pat on the back regarding the efficacy and equity amongst SNAP recipients; while this is internally valid for the small-town and rural Florida counties evaluated above, it is important to note that there should be caution in generalizing these outcomes to every state. States across the United States vary demographically and socioculturally, only two marginalized communities are evaluated in this study (Black and Hispanic) although there are a plethora of races and ethnicities that could be observed, the sample here consisted of 23 counties, and perhaps most importantly, living below the poverty level is not the sole marker of food insecurity. People can make a wage above the federal poverty level and still struggle to consistently have access to safe, nutritious foods and methods of preparing that food. While we know that families living in poverty in rural and small town Florida counties are largely receiving SNAP benefits, we must continue to investigate if these families still suffer from food insecurity and hunger. An even larger question still remains: is SNAP effective in achieving goals of increasing food access, health outcomes, and equity in rural and urban communities alike?
