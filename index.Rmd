## Milestone One - Interest and Thoughts

I am interested in exploring the relationship between food security and the rates of access to federal nutrition assistance programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infant, and Children (WIC), and School Breakfast and Lunch programs in rural communities. In the contemporary sociopolitical dialogue, "rural" is often used as a dog-whistle for white, though many rural communities of color exist in the South and in California. I would like to explore the rates of food insecurity in these communities and if they are receiving the aid they need from the government to increase access to safe, healthy foods.
